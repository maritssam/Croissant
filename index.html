    <h1>This page is about croissants 🥐</h1>
    <p>
      The earliest “known” written reference to a crescent-shaped pastry called
      a “croissant” is in a book published in 1853 titled “Des Substances
      Alimentaires Et Des Moyens de Les Améliorer, de Les Conserver,” which
      described croissants as a “bread of fantasy and luxury.” But that was a
      sort of science cookbook.
